Title
From Novice to Ninja: Practical Code Generation with Chat GPT
Description
Join us for an interactive workshop focused on practical code generation using Language Model AIs (LLMs), including Chat GPT. This workshop is designed for developers who want to explore the potential of LLMs and leverage them to streamline their coding workflow.
During the workshop, we'll guide you through the process of building a simple Telegram ChatBot using Java. However, the techniques and principles we cover can be applied to other programming languages as well, making it relevant to developers of various backgrounds.
Activities covered during the workshop:
1.  Refining advertisement text
2.  Exploring solutioning scenarios (think of it as an "advanced Google" case)
3.  Generating code in Java and SQL
4.  Refactoring existing code
5.  Managing configurations effectively
6.  Ensuring comprehensive code test coverage
Through hands-on exercises, you'll gain practical insights into the capabilities of LLMs and witness their impact on code generation. Join us for an engaging learning experience where you'll discover how Chat GPT and other LLMs can empower you to write better code and enhance your development practices.

The task

Hey there! I'm organizing a marketing event specifically for music managers. As part of this initiative, I've decided to create a Telegram bot that will provide more information about the event and allow users to register. I also need to keep track of conversions from our ads and count the number of registrations.

To add an extra touch, we have limited spots available for registration. That means it's important for us to display the remaining number of places and prevent further registrations once we're fully booked.

For this task, we'll be utilizing Java technologies. So, let's dive into this challenge and create a Telegram bot that not only shares event details and manages registrations but also keeps a record of conversions. By leveraging the power of Chat GPT, we'll enhance the overall user experience and create a seamless event registration process.
